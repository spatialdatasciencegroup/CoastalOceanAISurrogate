# [IPDPS '25] Accelerate Coastal Ocean Circulation Model with AI Surrogate
This repository contains the implementation of the AI surrogate model that accelerates coastal ocean circulation simulations. The model is based on 4D Swin Transformer architecture and trained on high-resolution coastal ocean data generated by Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS).

## Code Structure
```
model/          # Model architecture definitions
├── swift_module.py   # SWIFT module implementation
└── swin_unetr_4d.py  # Main model architecture
dataset.py      # Data loading and preprocessing
train.py        # Training loop implementation
utils.py        # Utility functions
```

## Get Started
You can launch the training with the following command:
```bash
torchrun \
  --nnodes <NUM_NODES> \
  --nproc_per_node <NUM_GPUS_PER_NODE> \
  --rdzv_id <UNIQUE_JOB_ID> \
  --rdzv_backend c10d \
  --rdzv_endpoint <MASTER_IP>:<MASTER_PORT> \
  main.py \
  --data_path <DATA_PATH> \
  --output_path <OUTPUT_PATH>
```

## Data Access
The preprocessed training data can be accessed through our [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bRtW9Wu0BSlErEkoF3d5DeyVn7M_92z0?usp=sharing). Please contact the authors if you have any issues accessing the data.
